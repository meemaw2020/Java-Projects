# Welcome to my Java practice projects

Hi! My name is Phone Myint Maw and these files include my **Java projects** based on the tutorials found online. These are not the exact same projects found on these tutorials because I combined a lot of things I learned throughout the self-learning phase. If there are like-minded people like me in these ideas, I hope to be able to help a little by these projects. Cheers!
